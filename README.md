First try at Game Dev. Choosing SDL3 (3.2.0) as the latest released SDL, and as a C-based Multimedia engine. 

Hope is the learn the basics of game development  and what really goes into making games. As well as practice C programming in a different context than just embedded development. 

Game has no Name yet, as I don't expect it to be anything complex enough, but if that changes, the game shall be named. 

The spirtes used (and that are going to be used) are downloaded from: https://brackeysgames.itch.io/brackeys-platformer-bundle
